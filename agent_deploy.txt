Remote agents will need to check the balance of their wallet when deciding to engage for a specific action.
Currently the balance.js file will retrieve the balance for each agent.
Once the balance is retrieved it will be passed into balance.txt and be checked by a python script.

The balance.sh file is responsible to call the previous instructions using a cron job that runs every 60 seconds:

* * * * * (export DISPLAY=:0.0; cd /home/ubuntu/slayinstagram; ./balance.sh)

ALL ethgram contents must be in the slayinstagram directory.
